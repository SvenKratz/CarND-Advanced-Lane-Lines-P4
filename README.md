## Advanced Lane Finding

This repository contains my solution to the Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree Advanced Lane Finding Project.

The repository contains the following notable files:

* [Advanced Lane Finding Project.ipynb](Advanced Lane Finding Project.ipynb) Jupyter notebook that contains the Python code of the single-image and video pipelines. It also contains many output images of the pipeline steps.
* [lanefinding_output.mp4](lanefinding_output.mp4) output video of the video processing step with lane lines, curvature and vehicle centering reported.
* [writeup.md](writeup.md) Project writeup report.
* `camera_calibration.p` Python pickle file containing the camera calibration data
* `output_images` Example output images. Also used in the writeup.
